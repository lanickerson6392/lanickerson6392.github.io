    <h1 class="aboutmeheader"> Who Am I?</h1>
    <p class="whoiam">My name is Lynsi Nickerson.  I am currently a junior level student studying at Florida Gulf Coast University.
  I am pursuing a B.S. Degree in Software Engineering with a minor in Digital Media Design.  I aim to obtain this degree by the year 2020.<br />
  My prefered future career is in the field of computer applications software development, but I haven't completely made up my mind yet.  I am
  very passionate about computers and computer software.  I have always been extremely interested in these things for as long 
  as I can remember.  I hope that I am able to join a career one day where I can truly pour out my love for computers and make life better
  for everyone through the software I develop.</p>
